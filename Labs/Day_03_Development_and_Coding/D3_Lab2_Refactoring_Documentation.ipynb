    "Writing code is only the first step; writing *good* code is what makes a project successful in the long run. In this lab, you will use an LLM as a code quality expert. You will refactor a poorly written function to make it cleaner and then generate professional-grade documentation, including docstrings and a README file. These are high-value tasks that AI can significantly accelerate.\n",
