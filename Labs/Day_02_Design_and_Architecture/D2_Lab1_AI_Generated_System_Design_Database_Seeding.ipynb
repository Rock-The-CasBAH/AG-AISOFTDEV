    "### Challenge 3 (Advanced): Creating and Seeding a Live Database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** This is a critical technical step. You will write a Python script to execute the generated SQL files, creating a live `onboarding.db` file that your application will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Complete the `create_database` function below.\n",
    "2.  The function should first connect to (and thus create) a SQLite database file named `artifacts/onboarding.db`.\n",
    "3.  It should then open and execute the `schema.sql` file to create the tables.\n",
    "4.  Finally, it should open and execute the `seed_data.sql` file to populate the tables.\n",
    "5.  Use a `try...finally` block to ensure the database connection is always closed, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint:** The `try...finally` block is a crucial Python pattern. The code in the `finally` block will run whether the `try` block succeeds or fails, making it the perfect place to ensure resources like database connections are always closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A physical `onboarding.db` file in your `artifacts` folder. This is a tangible asset that proves your design is valid and provides a concrete foundation for backend development."

    "    Create and seed a SQLite database from SQL files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Purpose:\n",
    "    This function creates a SQLite database, executes a schema SQL file to define the database structure,\n",
    "    and populates it with seed data from a separate SQL file. It ensures the database adheres to ACID principles\n",
    "    and is modular and scalable for future enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Parameters:\n",
    "    - `db_path` (str): Path to the SQLite database file. If the file exists, it will be replaced to ensure a clean slate.\n",
    "    - `schema_path` (str): Path to the SQL file containing the database schema.\n",
    "    - `seed_path` (str): Path to the SQL file containing the seed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Rules:\n",
    "    1. **Scalability**:\n",
    "       - Ensure the function can handle larger schemas and seed data files by using efficient file handling and execution techniques.\n",
    "       - Modularize the logic to allow for future extensions, such as adding support for additional SQL scripts or database types.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Modularity**:\n",
    "       - Separate concerns by clearly defining the steps for schema creation, data seeding, and error handling.\n",
    "       - Use helper functions where appropriate to keep the code clean and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **TOGAF Principles**:\n",
    "       - Ensure the database aligns with the architecture's principles of modularity, scalability, and maintainability.\n",
    "       - Design the function to support future integration with UML/SysML diagrams for database visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **ACID Principles**:\n",
    "       - Ensure atomicity by committing all changes only after successful execution of both schema and seed data scripts.\n",
    "       - Maintain consistency by validating the existence and correctness of the schema and seed files before execution.\n",
    "       - Use transactions to ensure data integrity in case of errors.\n",
    "       - Ensure durability by committing changes to the database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Returns:\n",
    "    - None: The function creates the database file and populates it with data, with no return value.\n",
