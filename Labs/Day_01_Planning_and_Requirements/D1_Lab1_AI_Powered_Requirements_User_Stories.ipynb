    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to the first hands-on lab of the AI-Driven Software Engineering Program! All great software projects begin with a clear understanding of the problem to be solved. In this lab, you will take on the role of a tech lead or product manager and use an LLM as a co-pilot to transform a simple, high-level problem into a set of well-defined, actionable requirements. This process is fundamental to ensuring that the team builds the *right* product.\n",

You can change the `model_name` parameter in the `setup_llm_client()` function to any of the models listed in the `RECOMMENDED_MODELS` dictionary in `utils.py`. For example, to use a Hugging Face model, you could change the line to: `client, model_name, api_provider = setup_llm_client(model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\")`\n",

They need to ensure that all new hires receive the same level of information and training, comply with company policies, and are set up for success. The digital onboarding tool will help them automate and personalize the onboarding experience, track the progress of new hires, and generate reports on onboarding effectiveness and compliance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed the first lab. You started with a vague, one-sentence problem and finished with a structured, validated, machine-readable requirements artifact. This is the critical first step in an AI-assisted software development lifecycle. The `day1_user_stories.json` file you created will be the direct input for our next lab, where we will generate a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** The single most important skill demonstrated in this lab is turning unstructured ideas into structured, machine-readable data (JSON). This transformation is what enables automation and integration with other tools later in the SDLC."
