      "The New Hire Onboarding Tool is designed to streamline and enhance the onboarding experience for new employees, HR managers, and department managers. By providing a centralized platform with personalized learning paths, progress tracking, compliance modules, and integration with existing HR systems, the tool aims to improve new hire efficiency and engagement while reducing the administrative burden on HR and department managers. The ultimate vision is to create a seamless onboarding experience that accelerates new hire productivity and fosters a sense of belonging within the organization.\n",

      "  \n",
      "- **Persona 2: HR Manager**\n",
      "  - Scenario: HR managers spend excessive time on manual tasks, such as tracking new hire progress and answering repetitive queries, reducing their capacity to focus on strategic HR initiatives.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Persona 3: Department Manager**\n",
      "  - Scenario: Department managers find it challenging to track their team's onboarding progress and provide timely support, impacting the overall performance and morale of their teams.\n",

    "2.  Save this generated model code to a file named `app/validation_models/prd_model.py`.\n",

You also created a Pydantic model to enforce the structure of this document, introducing automated governance into your workflow.
