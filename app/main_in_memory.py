    Retrieves all users from the in-memory database.
    
    This endpoint returns a complete list of all users currently stored in the
    in-memory database. Unlike the SQLAlchemy version, this implementation doesn't
    support pagination and returns all users at once. It's suitable for small
    datasets and development/testing purposes.
    
    Args:
        None
    
    Returns:
        List[User]: A list of all user objects in the database, each containing:
            - id (int): Unique user identifier
            - name (str): User's full name
            - email (str): User's email address
            - role (str): User's role in the organization
            
            Returns empty list if no users exist.
    
    Raises:
        None: This endpoint doesn't raise exceptions as it simply returns
            the current state of the in-memory list.
    
    Notes:
        - No pagination support (returns all users)
        - Data is stored in memory and will be lost on server restart
        - Includes two pre-populated example users on startup
        - Async function for compatibility with FastAPI's async support
        - Consider adding pagination for production use with larger datasets
    
    Example:
        >>> # GET /users/
        >>> # Response (200 OK):
        >>> [

    Retrieves a single user by their ID from the in-memory database.
    
    This endpoint searches through the in-memory user list to find and return
    a user with the specified ID. It performs a linear search through the list,
    which is acceptable for small datasets but may be slow for large ones.
    
    Args:
        user_id (int): The unique identifier of the user to retrieve.
            Must be a positive integer. The ID should correspond to an
            existing user in the in-memory database.
    
    Returns:
        User: A Pydantic model representing the requested user with fields:
            - id (int): The user's unique identifier (same as requested)
            - name (str): The user's full name

            - 422 Unprocessable Entity: If user_id is not a valid integer
              (handled automatically by FastAPI)
    
    Notes:
        - Performs O(n) linear search through the user list
        - The user_id is extracted from the URL path parameter
        - Data is volatile and stored only in memory
        - Async function for compatibility with FastAPI's async support

    Creates a new user in the in-memory database.
    
    This endpoint accepts user information and creates a new user in the in-memory
    database. Unlike the SQLAlchemy version, this doesn't check for duplicate
    emails and uses a simple incremental ID generation strategy. The created user
    is immediately available but will be lost when the server restarts.
    
    Args:
        user (UserCreate): A Pydantic model containing the user data to create.
            Required fields:
            - name (str): Full name of the user
            - email (str): Email address for the user (uniqueness not enforced)
            - role (str): User's role in the organization

    Raises:
        None: This endpoint doesn't perform validation beyond Pydantic's
            type checking. Duplicate emails are allowed in this implementation.
    
    Notes:
        - IDs are generated sequentially based on current list length
        - No email uniqueness validation (allows duplicates)
        - No persistence - data is lost on server restart
        - Thread-safety issues possible with concurrent requests
