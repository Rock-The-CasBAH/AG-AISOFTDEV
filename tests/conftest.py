We are going to create two files: conftest.py and test_main_with_fixture.py.
 The conftest.py will set up the test database and fixtures.
 The test_main_with_fixture.py will contain the tests using the fixtures.

 We note that the application code is provided in the same file (main.py) and we are going to import from it.

 However, note that the provided application code is in a single block. We must structure our test files to work with that.

 Since the application code defines:
   - Base (declarative base)
   - User and OnboardingTask models
   - app (FastAPI instance)
   - get_db dependency

 We will import these in our conftest.py and test_main_with_fixture.py.

 Steps for conftest.py:
   1. Create an in-memory SQLite database engine.
   2. Create a SessionLocal for tests.
   3. Create a fixture for the database session that creates the tables before and drops them after (or use transactions and rollback).
   4. Override the get_db dependency to use the test session.
   5. Provide a client fixture that uses the overridden app.

 We choose function scope for isolation. We will create and drop the tables for each test function.

 However, note that creating and dropping tables for every test might be slow if we have many tests.
 Alternatively, we can use transactions and rollback after each test. But since we are using SQLite in-memory, 
 and the number of tests is small, we can use the create_all and drop_all approach.

 Let's design the fixtures:

   - engine: create an in-memory SQLite engine (session scope, so we create it once for the test session)
   - Base.metadata.create_all and drop_all: we can do this in a fixture that runs per test (function scope) or per session.

 But note: if we drop the tables, we lose the schema. So we must create the tables for each test if we drop them after.

 Alternatively, we can use a transaction and rollback after each test. However, SQLite doesn't fully support nested transactions.

 We'll go with the following:

   - engine: created once per test session (session scope)
   - tables: created for each test (function scope) and then dropped after the test.

 But note: the application code already creates the tables (Base.metadata.create_all) when the main module is run.
 We don't want that to interfere with tests. We are going to override the database URL and the get_db dependency.

 We are going to:

   1. Create a new engine for tests (in-memory) in conftest.py.
   2. Create a new SessionLocal for tests.
   3. In a fixture (function scope), create the tables and then drop them after the test.

 However, note that the application code already creates the tables when run. We are not running the application code in the test setup.

 We are going to import the Base from the application code (which is in the provided code block) and then use it to create the tables.

 Since the application code is provided as a string, we cannot import it directly. But note: the problem says to output the two files.

 We are going to assume that the application code is in a module named `main` (if we were to save it as main.py). However, the provided code is in the same file as the test instructions.

 But note: the problem says to output the two files and nothing else.

 We are going to write the conftest.py and test_main_with_fixture.py as if the application code is in a module named `main`.

 However, the provided code is not modularized. It defines the app and the models in the same file.

 We are going to assume that we are running the tests in the same directory as the main.py file.

 Alternatively, we can refactor the application code into a module, but the problem says not to change the application code.

 The problem says: "Using the application source provided below"

 We are going to use the provided application code by including it in the test files? No, that would be duplication.

 Instead, we are going to assume that the application code is in a file named `main.py` and we are going to import from it.

 But note: the provided code has a block at the bottom for running with uvicorn. We don't want to run that during tests.

 We can structure our tests by:

   - In conftest.py, we import the necessary components from the main module (which is the application code).

 However, the problem says: "Output only the raw Python contents for the two files and nothing else."

 So we write:

   === FILE: conftest.py ===
   ... code for conftest.py ...

   === FILE: test_main_with_fixture.py ===
   ... code for test_main_with_fixture.py ...

 Let's write the conftest.py first.

 We are going to:

   - Import the necessary modules (pytest, FastAPI, TestClient, etc.)
   - Import from the main module (which we assume is named `main` and contains the provided code) the Base, app, get_db, etc.

 Steps:

   1. Create a test database engine (in-memory SQLite).
   2. Create a TestingSessionLocal class (sessionmaker) bound to the test engine.
   3. Create a fixture that creates the tables (Base.metadata.create_all) and then drops them after the test.
   4. Create a fixture that returns a database session from TestingSessionLocal and closes it after the test.
   5. Override the get_db dependency to use the test session.
   6. Create a fixture that returns a TestClient for the app with the overridden dependency.

 However, note: the application code already has a get_db function that uses the production database.

 We are going to override `main.get_db` to use our test session.

 But wait: the application code is provided as a string. We don't have a module named `main` unless we save the provided code as main.py.

 Since the problem says to use the provided application code, we assume that the code is in a module named `main`.

 Alternatively, if we are running the tests in the same file, we might have to adjust. But the problem says to generate two files.

 We are going to write the conftest.py as if we have a module named `main` that contains:

   - Base
   - app
   - get_db
   - User, OnboardingTask (if needed)

 But note: the test_main_with_fixture.py will also import from `main`.

 However, the problem says: "generate two Python files for pytest-based isolated DB testing"

 We are going to write the two files.

 Let's code accordingly.

 Important: We must ensure that the tests are isolated and use the in-memory database.

 We'll write the conftest.py with the following fixtures:

   - test_db_engine: session-scoped, returns the in-memory engine.
   - test_db_session: function-scoped, creates the tables and then drops them, yields a session.
   - override_get_db: a function that yields the test_db_session.
   - client: function-scoped, overrides the get_db dependency and returns a TestClient.

 However, note: the application code (main) has a get_db function that we want to override.

 We'll do:

   app.dependency_overrides[main.get_db] = override_get_db

 But we must define override_get_db to yield the test session.

 Let's write the code for conftest.py.

 Note: We must also handle the fact that the application code might have already created the tables for the production database.
 We are not using the production database in tests, so that's okay.

 We are going to create the tables in the test database (in-memory) for each test and then drop them.

 Alternatively, we can use a transaction and rollback. But for simplicity, we'll create and drop tables.

 Since we are using SQLite in-memory, creating and dropping tables is fast.
