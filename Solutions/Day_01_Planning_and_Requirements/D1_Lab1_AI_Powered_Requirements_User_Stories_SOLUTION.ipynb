    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "This notebook contains the complete solution for Lab 1. It demonstrates how to use an LLM to systematically break down a problem, generate structured requirements, and programmatically validate the output. Each step includes explanations of the code and the reasoning behind the prompts.\n",

    "## Step 1: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This initial block of code prepares our environment for the lab. It adds the project root to the system path to ensure our `utils.py` helper script can be imported, and then initializes the LLM API client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "Our `utils.py` script is configured to work with multiple AI providers. You can change the `model_name` parameter in the `setup_llm_client()` function to any of the models listed in the `RECOMMENDED_MODELS` dictionary in `utils.py`. For example, to use a Hugging Face model, you could change the line to: `client, model_name, api_provider = setup_llm_client(model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Libraries Explained:**\n",
    "- **`os`**, **`sys`**: Standard Python libraries for interacting with the file system and Python's path, ensuring our modules are discoverable.\n",
    "- **`json`**: A standard library for working with JSON data. We use `json.loads` to parse the LLM's text output into a Python dictionary or list, and `json.dumps` to format Python objects into a pretty-printed JSON string for saving.\n",
    "- **`utils`**: Our custom helper script. \n",
    "  - `setup_llm_client()`: Handles reading the `.env` file and initializing the API client.\n",
    "  - `get_completion()`: Simplifies the process of sending a prompt to the LLM and receiving a text response.\n",
    "  - `save_artifact()`: Ensures our project artifacts are stored consistently in the `artifacts` directory.\n",
    "  - `clean_llm_output()`: A new standardized function to remove markdown fences from LLM outputs."

    "1.  **Persona:** `You are a Senior Product Manager...` tells the LLM the role it should adopt.\n",

    "3.  **Format:** The `OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS` section is extremely explicit. It tells the LLM to *only* output JSON, defines the exact keys for each object, and specifies the format for nested data (like the array of Gherkin strings). This strictness is key to getting reliable, machine-readable output.\n",
    "4.  **Parsing:** The `try...except` block is a crucial step. It attempts to parse the LLM's string output into a Python list of dictionaries. If it succeeds, we know the LLM followed our instructions perfectly. If it fails, we print the raw output to help debug the prompt."

This creates a trustworthy `day1_user_stories.json` file that can be confidently used as an input for other automated processes in our SDLC."
