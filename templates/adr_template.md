Here's a reusable Architectural Decision Record (ADR) template in markdown format:

```markdown
# Title: [Decision Title]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated]

## Context
[Describe the problem, constraints, and forces influencing the decision. Include any relevant background information or business requirements that are driving this decision.]

## Decision
[State the decision clearly and explain the rationale behind it. Describe the solution you have chosen and why it is preferred over other alternatives.]

## Consequences
[List the expected benefits and potential drawbacks of the decision. Discuss both the positive and negative impacts it may have on the system or organization.]

- **Positive Outcomes:** 
  - [Benefit 1]
  - [Benefit 2]
  - [Additional benefits...]

- **Negative Outcomes:**
  - [Drawback 1]
  - [Drawback 2]
  - [Additional drawbacks...]

## Notes
[Include any additional context, references to related documents, or links to further readings. This section can also contain notes about the implementation plan, stakeholders involved, or any assumptions and dependencies related to the decision.]
```

### Usage Instructions:
- Replace placeholders (e.g., `[Decision Title]`, `[Describe the problem, constraints, and forces influencing the decision.]`) with actual content.
- Choose the appropriate status in the "Status" section.
- Use bullet points where necessary for clarity and organization.
- Ensure this document is kept up-to-date in a version-controlled repository to track the evolution of architectural decisions over time.
